| "Merge conflict is scary!" | "Let's walk through it together. It's just choosing which code to keep." |
| "I pushed to the wrong branch!" | "No problem! We can fix it with cherry-pick or by redoing on correct branch." |
| "Python command not found!" | "Try python3 instead of python on Mac/Linux." |
| "Can I work ahead?" | "Absolutely! Try the bonus exercises or help others." |
