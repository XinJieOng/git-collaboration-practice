## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

Follow PEP 8 style guidelines:

```python
# Good: Clear variable names, proper spacing
def calculate_total_price(items, tax_rate=0.08):
    subtotal = sum(item.price for item in items)
    total = subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)
    return total

# Bad: Unclear names, poor formatting
def calc(i,t=0.08):
    s=sum(x.p for x in i)
    return s*(1+t)
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `TaskManager`, `Task`)
- **Functions/Methods:** `snake_case` (e.g., `add_task`, `count_completed`)
- **Variables:** `snake_case` (e.g., `task_list`, `user_input`)
- **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_TASKS`, `DEFAULT_PRIORITY`)

### Code Comments

```python
# Good: Explain WHY, not WHAT
# Calculate tax separately for accurate financial reporting
tax = subtotal * tax_rate

# Bad: State the obvious
# Add tax to subtotal
tax = subtotal * tax_rate
```

### Function Documentation

```python
def add_task(self, title, description="", priority="medium"):
    """
    Add a new task to the task list.
    
    Args:
        title (str): The task title (required)
        description (str): Optional task description
        priority (str): Priority level: 'high', 'medium', or 'low'
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if task was added successfully, False otherwise
    """
    # Implementation...
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

### Format

```
<type>: <subject>

<body (optional)>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

‚úÖ Good commit messages:
```
feat: Add task priority feature with color-coded display

fix: Correct completed task counter logic

docs: Update README with new installation steps

refactor: Simplify task filtering logic for better readability
```

‚ùå Bad commit messages:
```
Update
Fix bug
Changes
asdf
```

### Tips for Good Commits

1. **Start with a verb** (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
2. **Be specific** about what changed
3. **Keep the first line under 50 characters**
4. **Add details in the body** if needed
5. **One logical change per commit**

## Questions?

### Where to Ask

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs or feature requests
- **Pull Request Comments**: For questions about your specific changes
- **Class Discussion**: For general Git/Python questions

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I work on multiple exercises at once?**
A: It's better to create separate branches for each exercise and submit separate PRs. This makes reviewing easier.

**Q: What if someone else is working on the same exercise?**
A: That's fine! Everyone should complete all exercises. You'll see different approaches in the PRs.

**Q: My PR has merge conflicts. What do I do?**
A: Update your branch with the latest main:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts
git commit
git push
```

**Q: Can I improve code that's not part of my exercise?**
A: Absolutely! But create a separate PR with a clear description of the improvement.
